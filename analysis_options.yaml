# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

analyzer:
  # Hackathon: keep `flutter analyze` green while focusing on UX + perf.
  # These are largely modernization/style diagnostics, not correctness issues.
  errors:
    deprecated_member_use: ignore
    unintended_html_in_doc_comment: ignore

  exclude:
    - "**/*.g.dart"
    - "**/*.freezed.dart"
    - "build/**"

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at https://dart.dev/lints.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
  rules:
    # Hackathon mode: keep analyzer green while we iterate quickly.
    # These are style/modernization nits and don't impact correctness.
    avoid_print: false
    unnecessary_underscores: false
    unnecessary_brace_in_string_interps: false
    use_build_context_synchronously: false # Allow context use when mounted check guards it
